# Ugmania_Template_Mod
The basic template for Ugmania mods. Contains some example stuff.

#source
This is the source folder containing the actual plugin csharp project. You need this to code the plugin. Note after building your plugin it will be in source/bin/debug/netstandard2.0/

#template_mod
This is the actual mod folder that you would put in your game. It contains a basic info.json (which is used by ugmania to get all info about the mod) and the .dll plugin file (which you will replace when you re-build your mod)
